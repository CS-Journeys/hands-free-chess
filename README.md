# Hands-Free Chess
Play chess online using only your voice instead of a keyboard and mouse!

## Getting started
1. Install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) (version 3.6 is required for using the SpeechRecognition library)
2. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
(Installing in a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) is highly recommended)  
3. Mac Users:  
    a. Open System Preferences  
    b. Navigate to Security & Privacy > Screen Recording  
    c. Click the lock icon to make a change  
    d. Make sure your python IDE (PyCharm, Idle, etc.) or the `Terminal` is checked off. This allows the application to monitor your screen while you play so it can recognize the board and pieces.

## Usage
1. Run ```py app.py``` or ```python app.py``` via the command line  
2. Follow the instructions from the "Help" button
